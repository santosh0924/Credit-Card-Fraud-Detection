# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Project Summary

Financial fraud is a major concern in banking and financial services and costs millions of dollars every year. Credit card fraud continues to rise due to highly imbalanced dataset and non-stationary nature of data. It is estimated that some organization have losses up to 5% due to fraud and recent studies point that fraud activities have risen and expected to increase in future. Losses to financial institution can be avoided by detecting credit card fraud and alerting banks about potential fraudulent transactions.

The first step in building a model is to get the dataset. One of the main issues with credit card fraud detection is unavailability of real dataset. Since the credit card data will have sensitive details about the customer, there are not many datasets available due to privacy issues. Another challenge with credit card dataset is that it is highly imbalanced where there are more legitimate transactions and few fraudulent transactions. Millions of transactions are processed every day and the size of the dataset will be huge. Feature selection technique is applied to use only required features and machine learning algorithm using Random Forest Classifier is used to evaluate and effectively predict fraudulent transactions.
